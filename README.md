Day 39 - Flight deal hunter  

Uses the APIs below attached to a spreadsheet on google docs to look at airplane prices for cities I've specified in my spreadsheet.
I've included a price threshold that I'm willing to pay. This program will do an api call to the kiwi api to see if theres a cheaper flight at the moment and if so will inform me by sending an sms through twilio
